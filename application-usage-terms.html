                        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release StorX and the other Company Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. You expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code § 1542 as well as any other statute or common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-2"><b>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</b></p>
                        <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH STORX AND LIMITS HOW YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
                        <p>Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands, or proceedings (collectively, "Disputes'') in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and StorX (a) waive your and StorX respective rights to have any Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement or the Services resolved in a court, and (b) waive your and StorX's respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and StorX will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>
                        <p>Any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services is personal to you and StorX, and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>
                        <p>Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to StorX will be sent by e-mail to info@storx.io. Notice to you will be by email to the then-current email address in your Account. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address, and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific resolution/update that you are seeking. If you and StorX cannot agree on how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Storx may, as appropriate and per this Section, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 17.1, file a claim in court.</p>
                        <p>Any arbitration will occur in Seychelles. The arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator following the rules of the Arbitration. The state and federal courts located in Seychelles will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p>
                        <p>This Agreement and the applicable Arbitration, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in a court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
                        <p>By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood the rules of  Arbitration, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of Arbitration and any claim that the rules of Arbitration are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-2"><b>Severability</b></p>
                        <p>If any term, clause, or provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause, or provision will be severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of this Agreement.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-2"><b>Termination or Suspension</b></p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement or suspend your right to access the Services. You may terminate this Agreement without notice by discontinuing the use of the Services. All rights and licenses granted to you under this Agreement will immediately be revoked upon our termination of the Agreement or our suspension of your access to the Services, and you must immediately submit payment for any fees payable to StorX under the Agreement (as specified).

                        <p class="mb-2"><b>Amendment</b></p>
                        <p>We reserve the right to change the terms of this Agreement from time to time at our sole discretion. If we make changes to the Agreement, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by posting the revised Agreement terms to the Services and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms and the Storage Terms. Your continued use of the Services will confirm your acceptance of the revised Agreement. If you do not agree to the modified Agreement, you must stop using the Services.</p>
