            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</p>

            <strong style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong>

            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Consent</strong>. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose.

                    <p>Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li>

We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Vital Interests</strong>. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p></li>

            <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent).

                <li>●	For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
                <li>●	If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
                <li>●	If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                <li>●	If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
                <li>●	If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
                <li>●	If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
                <li>●	If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>

            <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
