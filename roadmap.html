                            <p>StorX Network will be looking to bring on individuals or organizations that will help promote and sell their products or services. These sales partners would be responsible for identifying potential customers and closing deals on behalf of the StorX Network. By recruiting sales partners worldwide, the StorX Network would be able to expand its reach and increase its revenue.</p>
                            <p>The sales partners might be incentivized with a commission based on the sales they bring in, or some other form of compensation. This would allow them to earn money by helping the network grow and expand. Sales partners could be independent sales people, existing businesses, ororganizations that have a large customer base that could benefit from StorX Network's offerings.</p>
                            <p>This approach can help the StorX Network to reach a wider audience, expand its customer base, and generate more revenue, as the sales partners can leverage their existing relationships, networks, and expertise.</p>
                            <p>It's important to note that the selection of the sales partners should be done carefully and with clear criteria and that they should be trained and given the necessary tools to represent the network in a professional way.</p>
