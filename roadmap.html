The overwhelming response in favor of this change has inspired us to take the necessary steps to implement this transformation. Our team is hard at work researching and developing a secureand sustainable deflationary model to ensure the long-term success of our network. We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition for our community and will keep you updated on our progress.

                            <p>StorX Network will be looking to bring on individuals or organizations that will help promote and sell their products or services. These sales partners would be responsible for identifying potential customers and closing deals on behalf of the StorX Network. By recruiting sales partners worldwide, the StorX Network would be able to expand its reach and increase its revenue.</p>
                            <p>The sales partners might be incentivized with a commission based on the sales they bring in, or some other form of compensation. This would allow them to earn money by helping the network grow and expand. Sales partners could be independent sales people, existing businesses, ororganizations that have a large customer base that could benefit from StorX Network's offerings.</p>
                            <p>This approach can help the StorX Network to reach a wider audience, expand its customer base, and generate more revenue, as the sales partners can leverage their existing relationships, networks, and expertise.</p>
                            <p>It's important to note that the selection of the sales partners should be done carefully and with clear criteria and that they should be trained and given the necessary tools to represent the network in a professional way.</p>

                    <h5 class="pb-1">Converting $SRX StorX Network into Deflationary Token</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">We at StorX Network would like to extend our sincere gratitude to our Twitter Community for their recent vote on whether our token should become deflationary. The overwhelming response in favor of this change has inspired us to take the necessary steps to implement this transformation. Our team is hard at work researching and developing a secureand sustainable deflationary model to ensure the long-term success of our network. We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition for our community and will keep you updated on our progress. Thank you for your continued support and for being a part of the StorX Network community.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="pb-1">Recruit Sales Partners Worldwide</h5>
                    <p class="mb-2">StorX Network will be looking to bring on individuals or organizations that will help promote and sell their products or services. These sales partners would be responsible for identifying potential customers and closing deals on behalf of the StorX Network. By recruiting sales partners worldwide, the StorX Network would be able to expand its reach and increase its revenue.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">The sales partners might be incentivized with a commission based on the sales they bring in, or some other form of compensation. This would allow them to earn money by helping the network grow and expand. Sales partners could be independent sales people, existing businesses, ororganizations that have a large customer base that could benefit from StorX Network's offerings.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">This approach can help the StorX Network to reach a wider audience, expand its customer base, and generate more revenue, as the sales partners can leverage their existing relationships, networks, and expertise.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">It's important to note that the selection of the sales partners should be done carefully and with clear criteria and that they should be trained and given the necessary tools to represent the network in a professional way.</p>
