         exclusive jurisdiction should any dispute, claim or disagreement arise
         from them. StorX may update and amend these Terms and Conditions at any
         time and without prior notice, to adapt them to current regulations and
         to technological or business changes. The User should frequently verify
         the Terms and Conditions to ensure they always have the most up to date
         version. By accessing or using the websites, mobile applications and
         online services of StorX, including StorX.tech, StorX.io, (collectively,
         the “Services”) you will be bound by these Terms of Use (“Terms”) and all
         terms incorporated by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, you
         may not access or use the Services. If you have any questions regarding
         these Terms, please contact us at info@StorX.io. Please refer to our Privacy
         Policy for information about how we collect, use and disclose information about you.
       </p>

       <h3>Eligibility</h3>
       <p>You must be 18 years of age or older to access or use our Services. If
         you are using the Services on behalf of any entity: (a) you represent and
         warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf
         and that such entity will be responsible for breach of these Terms by you or
         any other employee or agent of such entity; and (b) references to “you” in these
         Terms refer to you and such entity, jointly.</p>

       <h3>Open Source Software</h3>
       <p>We suppose community based development. Hence our Services, including
         the Storage Platform, available for download as open source software.
         You agree to be bound by, and comply with, any license agreement that
         applies to this open source software. You will not indicate that you are
         associated with StorX in connection with any of your modifications or
         distributions of this open source software. The source code we release
         in connection with open source software is not part of the Services, and
         your use of that source code without interacting with our Services is not
         subject to these Terms. For clarity, though, when we host any software and
         enable you to access and use such software as a service through our websites
         and apps, then these Terms will apply to such access and use.</p>

       <h3>Use of the Services</h3>
       <p>The Services, including all text, videos, images, data, software, or other
         files, content, and materials contained on the Services, are the proprietary
         property of StorX and our licensors. Subject to your compliance with these
         Terms, you may use the Services on a non-exclusive basis for your own personal
         use. Nothing in these Terms will be construed as conferring any right or license
         to any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights of StorX or any
         third party, whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise. To be clear, we do not
         claim any ownership over the content you submit via the Services.</p>

       <h3>Modifications to the Services</h3>
       <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify the Services (or any
         features or functionality of the Services) at any time without notice and without
         obligation or liability to you.</p>

       <h3>Repeat Infringer Policy and Copyright Complaints</h3>
       <p>We have a policy of limiting access to the Service and
         terminating the accounts of users who infringe the intellectual
         property rights of others. If you believe that anything on the
         Services infringes any copyright that you own or control, you
         may notify us using the email address info@StorX.io.</p>

       <h3>Trademarks</h3>

         that may appear on the Services, and the look and feel of the
         Services, including all page headers, custom graphics, button
         icons and scripts, are trademarks, service marks or trade dress
         of StorX and our suppliers and our licensors, and may not be copied,
         imitated or used, in whole or in part, without our or the applicable
         trademark holder’s prior written permission. You may not use any meta
         tags or other “hidden text” utilizing “StorX” or any other name, trademark
         or product or service name of StorX without our prior written permission.
         Further, you may not use, frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose

         of any page, or form contained on a page, on the Services without our express
         written consent.</p>

         attempt to bypass or circumvent measures employed to prevent or limit access to any content,
         area or functionality on the Services, without providing prior notice to StorX of the method
         used to bypass or circumvent; use any of the Services other than for its intended purposes;
         or use the Services to engage in or promote any activity that violates these Terms.</p>

           </ul>

       <ul>
         <li>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify,

       </ul>

       <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
       <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT,</p>
       <ul>
         <li>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
           AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AS TO THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
           IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT;</li>
         <li>WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT OR ERROR-FREE,
           MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED; AND</li>
         <li>WE CANNOT AND DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR OUR SERVERS ARE FREE
           OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Storage Platform</h3>
       <p>The Storage Services enable you to store data and other materials (“Storage Materials”) via a distributed
         network of third-party devices (“Storage Nodes”) that comprise the Storage Platform. The Storage Platform
         is an interconnected set of Storage Nodes that independently operate open-source software to facilitate the
         storage of your Storage Materials. Users acting as Storage Nodes acknowledge that they must comply with local
         Privacy Law. The Storage Services are designed to encrypt Storage Materials locally on your device and then
         facilitate the distribution of such encrypted data fragments to the Storage Nodes. The Storage Platform and
         Storage Nodes are not operated or maintained by StorX, and StorX has no responsibility or liability for the
         Storage Platform or Storage Nodes. The Storage Services enable you to protect against loss of your Storage
         Materials due to the failure of any individual Storage Node by allowing you to configure the redundancy and
         distribution of your Storage Materials. You are solely responsible for your use of the Storage Platform,
         including for configurations that you deem appropriate to maintain access to your Storage Materials in a manner
         that meets your expectations. In order to use the Storage Services, you will need to register for an account
         (“Account”). In connection with your creation of any Account, you will</p>
       <ul>
         <li>provide accurate, current and complete Account information,</li>
         <li>maintain and promptly update your Account information as necessary,</li>
         <li>maintain the security of your Account, including by not using the same
           password for the Storage Services that you use for third-party services,</li>
         <li>not disclose your password or private keys to any third party, and </li>
         <li> immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any unauthorized
           activities in connection with your Account or the Storage Services. You acknowledge
           and agree that if you lose your password, you may not be able to recover any Storage
           Materials. One same person cannot hold various free StorX accounts.
         </li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Storage Materials</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>StorX will not be responsible for any loss, misuse, or deletion of Storage Materials
           or any failure of any Storage Materials to be stored or encrypted. You are solely responsible
           for backing up any Storage Materials.
         </li>
         <li>You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Storage Services to store your
           Storage Materials via the Storage Platform, and for maintaining appropriate security of your
           Storage Materials, which may include the use of encryption. We reserve the right at any time,
           without notice, to remove, reject or delete any Storage Materials that contain plain text data
           or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement (including StorX Terms of Use relating to User
           Content).</li>
         <li>You are solely responsible for ensuring that any processing of Storage Materials via the Storage
           Services is in compliance with all applicable laws. We make no representations or warranties regarding
           the suitability of the Storage Services for the processing of any particular types of data. You will
           provide all notices to, and obtain any consents from, third parties as required by applicable law in
           connection with the processing of Storage Materials via the Storage Services. You must not process any
           Storage Materials that include sensitive data that require heightened security protections, including any
           <ul>
             <li>“protected health information,” as defined under HIPAA,</li>
             <li>“cardholder data,” as defined by the PCI DSS, or</li>
             <li>“Sensitive Personal Data” as defined under the EU Directive 95/46/EC as enacted
               in the member states of the European Union.
             </li>
           </ul>
         </li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Payment</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>We will provide notice via the Storage Services of the fees applicable to use of the
           Storage Services ('Fees'). All Fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes unless stated
           otherwise, which are your sole responsibility. We will provide notice at least 30 days in
           advance of any increase to the Fees.</li>
         <li>Except where otherwise indicated via the Storage Services, we will charge all Fees to a
           payment method designated by you via the Storage Services that is acceptable to us. You represent
           and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Storage Services
           and authorize us to charge all Fees to that method. If your payment method cannot be verified, is
           invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your right to use the Storage Services may be suspended
           automatically. Fees will be charged on a monthly basis based on the prior month’s usage. You can
           avoid incurring Fees at any time by discontinuing your use of the Storage Services to store your
           Storage Materials.</li>
         <li>Users with a free account who do not log in to their account for a period of one year will be
           considered inactive. Once a free account reaches that status, its files will be removed from the
           network in order to free up space for those free users who are actively using their account.</li>
         <li>Accounts on any of our premium plans who fail to renew their plan within a period of 7 days
           will be terminated.</li>
         <li>All users who buy any of StorX's premium plans will be eligible for a 30 day refund, unless
           they already receive a 30 day trial period of any of StorX's premium plan. After those first 30
           days using any of our premium plans have passed, no refund will be applicable. To request a refund,
           you should reach out to us via email, at hello@StorX.com.
         </li>
         <li>Storage Nodes agree to let StorX generate invoices on their behalf, so that both
           parties can legally justify the payment StorX sends to Storage Nodes every month. The
           invoice will be issued by the Storage Nodes (with the personal details he specifies at
           sign up), to StorX. Storage Nodes can contact us and request those invoices at any time.
         </li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Effect of Suspension or Termination</h3>
       <p>If your access to the Storage Services is suspended or terminated, you will no longer have access
         to the Storage Materials processed via the Storage Services for storage in the Storage Platform,
         and your Storage Materials may not be recoverable. If we terminate or suspend your access to the
         Storage Services for reasons other than your breach of the Agreement, we will make commercially
         reasonable efforts to provide you an opportunity to retrieve your Storage Materials via the Storage
         Services. We will terminate any free accounts that have no activity for one year (this includes any
         account that has not uploaded, downloaded, shared or modified a file in a period of one year). We
         will also terminate accounts under any of our paid plans, that fail to renew their plan after 7 days
         from the payment renewal deadline. Appropriate notice will be given to the user to try to avoid account
         termination.
