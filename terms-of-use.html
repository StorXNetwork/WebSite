Risks, uncertainties and assumptions include the possibility that expected benefits from our operational improvements or service offerings may not materialize. These statements are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates which are subject to significant uncertainties that involve risks, many of which are beyond our control and not guarantees of future performance. If such risks or uncertainties materialize or such assumptions prove incorrect, the results of StorX could differ materially from our current expectations as a result of many factors, including but not limited to: the unpredictable nature of our rapidly evolving market and quarterly fluctuations in our business; the effects of competition; and any adverse changes in our indirect channel relationships. These and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business are described in our quarterly and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.edgar.gov. Except as required by law, StorX assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.</p>
